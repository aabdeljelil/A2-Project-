# A2_Project
Code4policy/2020 final project

This website analyzes the scope and reach of disinformation on Twitter during the 2016 election and currently in 2020. We analyze past banned accounts and their activity in 2016, and monitor the current nature of fake-news propaganda on Twitter by active troll_bots.

For 2016, we used Twitter data publicly available at https://transparency.twitter.com/en/information-operations.html to look at IRA accounts infuencing the political discourse on the social media site. 

For current disinformation activity in 2020, we used the Tweepy Python package to gather data. We also used bot_sentinel's list of troll_bot accounts on Twitter, accounts that are either bots or human-controlled that spread fake news, unverified information, and troll content on Twitter. Further information on troll_bots can be found at the Bot_Sentinel site at https://botsentinel.com/

We used https://d3js.org/ and https://app.datawrapper.de/ for visualization and https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/# for data analysis.

To run the website locally, clone the git repository, cd into the web_pages folder and run a local server with the command "python3 -m http.server" and then click on the link.
